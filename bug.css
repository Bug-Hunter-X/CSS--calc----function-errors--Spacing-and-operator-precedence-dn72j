The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS, but sometimes it leads to unexpected errors due to missing spaces or incorrect operator precedence. For example, `width:calc(100%-10px)` will work correctly, but `width:calc(100%- 10px)` will not work because of the extra space between the minus sign and 10px.  Another issue is operator precedence: `width:calc(20px+10px*2)` will result in 40px (multiplication before addition). If you want 60px, use parentheses: `width:calc((20px+10px)*2)`
